I'm wrapping up this letter that I wrote you
Baby, it's the only way to go through
I won't lose myself for anybody
I'm not sorry, yeah

Though it hurts, I only wish you blessings
Intuition talks, you gotta listen
I won't lose myself for anybody
I'm not sorry, yeah
You build me up to break me down
Never respect the love you found
And I had a voice inside the back of my mind
I always do and deep down

But you don't deserve it, bae, won't lie
Got no emotions to cry
Oh-oh, no looking back this time

No looking back this time
No looking back this time
No looking back this time

Runnin' from the truth was getting reckless
In your arms, I never felt protectеd, oh

But you don't deserve it, baе, won't lie
Got no emotions to cry
Oh-oh, no looking back this time
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Woah)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
No looking back this time (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

No looking back this time
No looking back this time
No looking back this time

No looking back this time
